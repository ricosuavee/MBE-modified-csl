# MBE-modified-csl
A modified .csl file that includes formatting for bioRxiv preprints. 
Modified for integration with Zotero, not tested on other citation managers. 

The modification includes an added "preprint" macro, which pulls from Zotero's "Repository" field. The repository field is mapped to the "publisher" variable in CSL.  

This .csl file will add bioRxiv in italics after the the title of the preprint, followed by the URL of the preprint.
